# Data-Science-Assignment-Zeotap-E-commerce-Transaction
**Project Overview**
This project involves analyzing customer data, creating a lookalike model for similar customer recommendations, and performing customer segmentation through clustering techniques. The dataset consists of customer, product, and transaction information.
## Files and Description
1. **Customers.csv**: Contains customer profile information (CustomerID, Name, Region, SignupDate).
2. **Products.csv**: Contains product details (ProductID, Name, Category, Price).
3. **Transactions.csv**: Contains transaction history (TransactionID, CustomerID, ProductID, Date, Quantity, TotalValue, Price).

## Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- EDA was performed to derive insights from the dataset.
- Business insights were generated based on customer behavior, transactions, etc.


### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- A lookalike model was developed to recommend similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
- The model assigns a similarity score for each recommendation.
- The top 3 lookalike customers for the first 20 customers are stored in `Lookalike.csv`.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- Customer segmentation was done using clustering algorithms.
- Clustering metrics and visualizations are provided.
